Hello! My name is Kamily, I am 21 years old, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development.

At the beginning of my academic journey, I was highly drawn to Front-end development and UX Design, which allowed me to strengthen my sense of detail, usability, and creativity. Over time, I discovered a deeper interest in Back-end development and Data Engineering, where I found great satisfaction in building efficient systems, working with data pipelines, and designing scalable solutions.

I am motivated by continuous learning and enjoy combining technical skills with problem-solving to create impactful results. My current focus is on Data Engineering, Back-end Development, and Cloud Computing, but I remain curious and open to exploring different areas within technology.

I am eager to contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with talented teams, and grow as a professional in this exciting and dynamic field.
